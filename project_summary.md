# The hypnotic tranquility of the Go language specification.

## Description
I love particles and hope to develop a way to sketch arbitrary shapes using layers of autonomous tiny particle fish. I am driven to persue aesthetics and performance. The fish must be beautiful, a hypnotic and soothing chaos. The fish must be many, the more fish we can render and control the more enchanting is the experience.
