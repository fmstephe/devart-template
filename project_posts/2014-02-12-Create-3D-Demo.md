# Created 3D Floating Fish Demo
I have now created a demo which cheats a bit to create the impression of 3 dimensions. By simply varying the size of each fish we give a strong sense of depth. During this time I experimented with using webgl, specifically the three.dart library, but found the that the immaturity of the project and lack of documentation made progress very slow. I may revisit the use of webgl in the future.

The 3 dimensions and the slowed down fish make this demo more tranquil than the previous version.
